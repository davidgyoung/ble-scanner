# BLE Scanner

A command line utility for Bluetooth LE scanning on Linux / BlueZ

## Compiling

1. Install prerequisites

`sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev`

2. Compile the program

`cc scanner.c -lbluetooth -o scanner`

## Running

Run the program like this:

`./scanner`

Each time it detects a Bluetooth LE advertisement it prints out the MAC address of the advertisting device, the RSSI and the bytes of the advertisement like this:

```
B8:27:EB:1F:93:4D -68 02 01 06 11 06 82 75 25 D9 37 9D D7 8F 5F 4A F4 20 00 00 75 30
71:5C:23:9D:BC:7F -68 02 01 1A 02 0A 0C 0B FF 4C 00 10 06 03 1A 3B D4 B2 EB
B8:27:EB:1F:93:4D -68 02 01 06 11 06 82 75 25 D9 37 9D D7 8F 5F 4A F4 20 00 00 75 30
```

In the first line above, `B8:27:EB:1F:93:4D` is the hardware MAC address, -68 is the RSSI and the remaining values are the hex bytes of the advertisement.

The program will auto exit after one of two things happens:  (a) 10 seconds pass with no detections.  (b) 1000 advertisements are detected.  It does this for the sake of stability.  Rarely, the underlying bluetooth stack will crash.  By exiting after 10 seconds it allows you to restart the program and get new detections.  Running forever is actually less stable.
